# Memory Card Game Project

Now that we learned the basics to frontend developing, we started this first project to put our knowledge in practice. 
This is our card matching game with 4 different themes, one for each member of the group.

## Features
4 Themes : **Animal Crossing** 🐼 
**Pokemon** 🔴
**DBZ** 🐉 & 
**Vaporwave** 🌸  
3 difficulties: Easy, medium or hard.  
Solo mode and against the machine mode if you are feeling social!  
Background music and sound effects 🎶  
Responsive design.
